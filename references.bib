There are two kinds of antiferromagnetic domain walls, T (twin) and S (spin-rotation). A T wall is produced by rotation of the antiferromagnetic pattern of magnetic moments and an S wall by rotation of the direction of the magnetic moments. The T walls can be observed with polarized light, and both T- and S-type domains can be studied by neutron diffraction. Crystals with simple T-wall structures are produced by annealing at high temperature. The crystallography of the T walls can be understood in terms of a small rhombohedral deformation which accompanies the antiferromagnetic ordering. The T walls are easily displaced by the application of small mechanical stresses or magnetic fields. A crystal without T walls may still contain S walls, and these S walls also are displaced or rotated by magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {We report on measurements of magnetic field and temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic resonances in the prototypical antiferromagnet {NiO}. The frequencies of the magnetic resonances in the vicinity of 1 {THz} have been determined in the time-domain via time-resolved Faraday measurements after selective excitation by narrow-band superradiant terahertz ({THz}) pulses at temperatures down to 3 K and in magnetic fields up to 10 T. The measurements reveal two antiferromagnetic resonance modes, which can be distinguished by their characteristic magnetic field dependencies. The nature of the two modes is discussed by comparison to an eight-sublattice antiferromagnetic model, which includes superexchange between the next-nearest-neighbor Ni spins, magnetic dipolar interactions, cubic magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and Zeeman interaction with the external magnetic field. Our study indicates that a two-sublattice model is insufficient for the description of spin dynamics in {NiO}, while the magnetic-dipolar interactions and magneto-crystalline anisotropy play important roles.},

	abstract = {Optical magneto-spectroscopy methods (Raman scattering, far-infrared transmission, and photoluminescence) have been applied to investigate the properties of the {NiPS}3 semiconducting antiferromagnet. The fundamental magnon gap excitation in this van der Waals material has been found to be split into two components, in support of the biaxial character of the {NiPS}3 antiferromagnet. Photoluminescence measurements in the near-infrared spectral range show that the intriguing 1.475 {eV}-excitation unique to the {NiPS}3 antiferromagnetic phase splits upon the application of the in-plane magnetic field. The observed splitting patterns are correlated with properties of magnon excitations and reproduced with the simple model proposed. Possible routes toward a firm identification of the spin-entangled 1.475 {eV}-optical excitation in {NiPS}3, which can hardly be recognized as a coherent Zhang-Rice exciton, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Ultrafast control of magnets using femtosecond light pulses attracts interest regarding applications and fundamental physics of magnetism. Antiferromagnets are promising materials with magnon frequencies extending into the terahertz range. Visible or near-infrared light interacts mainly with the electronic orbital angular momentum. In many magnets, however, in particular with iron-group ions, the orbital momentum is almost quenched by the crystal field. Thus, the interaction of magnons with light is hampered, because it is only mediated by weak unquenching of the orbital momentum by spin–orbit interactions. Here we report all-optical excitation of magnons with frequencies up to 9 {THz} in antiferromagnetic {CoO} with an unquenched orbital momentum. In {CoO}, magnon modes are coupled oscillations of spin and orbital momenta with comparable amplitudes. We demonstrate excitations of magnon modes by directly coupling light with electronic orbital angular momentum, providing possibilities to develop magneto-optical devices operating at several terahertz with high output-to-input ratio.},

These walls can be moved in annealed crystals by small mechanical stresses (\&lt;106 d/cm2) or by moderate magnetic fields (\&lt;25 000 oe) to yield completely untwinned crystals. The ease with which a twin wall moves appears to be limited by a spin-rotation energy loss. Crystallographic measurements of the rhombohedral distortion agree with the x-ray data, and verify the [111] antiferromagnetic contraction. The anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility vs field has been measured for untwinned crystals, and is compared with earlier work.},

To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

	abstract = {The elementary spin excitations in strongly magnetic materials are collective spin deviations, or spin waves, whose quanta are called magnons. Interest in the experimental and theoretical investigation of magnons attracted many groups worldwide about 4–6 decades ago and then waned for some time. In recent years, with the advent of the field of spintronics, the area of magnonics has gained renewed attention. New phenomena have been discovered experimentally, and others have been predicted theoretically. In this tutorial, we briefly review the basic concepts of magnons in antiferromagnetic ({AF}) materials. Initially, we present a semiclassical view of the equilibrium spin configurations and of the antiferromagnetic resonance in {AF} materials with two types of magnetic anisotropy, easy-axis and easy-plane. Then, we present a quantum theory of magnons for these materials and apply the results to two important {AF} insulators, {MnF}2 and {NiO}. Finally, we introduce the concept of antiferromagnetic magnonic spin current that plays a key role in several phenomena in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

              How a certain ground state of complex physical systems emerges, especially in two-dimensional materials, is a fundamental question in condensed-matter physics. A particularly interesting case is systems belonging to the class of {XY} Hamiltonian where the magnetic order parameter of conventional nature is unstable in two-dimensional materials leading to a Berezinskii−Kosterlitz−Thouless transition. Here, we report how the {XXZ}-type antiferromagnetic order of a magnetic van der Waals material, {NiPS}
              3
              , behaves upon reducing the thickness and ultimately becomes unstable in the monolayer limit. Our experimental data are consistent with the findings based on renormalization-group theory that at low temperatures a two-dimensional {XXZ} system behaves like a two-dimensional {XY} one, which cannot have a long-range order at finite temperatures. This work provides the experimental examination of the {XY} magnetism in the atomically thin limit and opens opportunities of exploiting these fundamental theorems of magnetism using magnetic van der Waals materials.},
