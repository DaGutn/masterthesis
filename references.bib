There are two kinds of antiferromagnetic domain walls, T (twin) and S (spin-rotation). A T wall is produced by rotation of the antiferromagnetic pattern of magnetic moments and an S wall by rotation of the direction of the magnetic moments. The T walls can be observed with polarized light, and both T- and S-type domains can be studied by neutron diffraction. Crystals with simple T-wall structures are produced by annealing at high temperature. The crystallography of the T walls can be understood in terms of a small rhombohedral deformation which accompanies the antiferromagnetic ordering. The T walls are easily displaced by the application of small mechanical stresses or magnetic fields. A crystal without T walls may still contain S walls, and these S walls also are displaced or rotated by magnetic fields.},

The frequencies of the magnetic resonances in the vicinity of 1 {THz} have been determined in the time-domain via time-resolved Faraday measurements after selective excitation by narrow-band superradiant terahertz ({THz}) pulses at temperatures down to 3 K and in magnetic fields up to 10 T. The measurements reveal two antiferromagnetic resonance modes, which can be distinguished by their characteristic magnetic field dependencies. The nature of the two modes is discussed by comparison to an eight-sublattice antiferromagnetic model, which includes superexchange between the next-nearest-neighbor Ni spins, magnetic dipolar interactions, cubic magneto-crystalline anisotropy, and Zeeman interaction with the external magnetic field. Our study indicates that a two-sublattice model is insufficient for the description of spin dynamics in {NiO}, while the magnetic-dipolar interactions and magneto-crystalline anisotropy play important roles.},

	abstract = {Optical magneto-spectroscopy methods (Raman scattering, far-infrared transmission, and photoluminescence) have been applied to investigate the properties of the {NiPS}3 semiconducting antiferromagnet. The fundamental magnon gap excitation in this van der Waals material has been found to be split into two components, in support of the biaxial character of the {NiPS}3 antiferromagnet. Photoluminescence measurements in the near-infrared spectral range show that the intriguing 1.475 {eV}-excitation unique to the {NiPS}3 antiferromagnetic phase splits upon the application of the in-plane magnetic field. The observed splitting patterns are correlated with properties of magnon excitations and reproduced with the simple model proposed. Possible routes toward a firm identification of the spin-entangled 1.475 {eV}-optical excitation in {NiPS}3, which can hardly be recognized as a coherent Zhang-Rice exciton, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Ultrafast control of magnets using femtosecond light pulses attracts interest regarding applications and fundamental physics of magnetism. Antiferromagnets are promising materials with magnon frequencies extending into the terahertz range. Visible or near-infrared light interacts mainly with the electronic orbital angular momentum. In many magnets, however, in particular with iron-group ions, the orbital momentum is almost quenched by the crystal field. Thus, the interaction of magnons with light is hampered, because it is only mediated by weak unquenching of the orbital momentum by spin–orbit interactions. Here we report all-optical excitation of magnons with frequencies up to 9 {THz} in antiferromagnetic {CoO} with an unquenched orbital momentum. In {CoO}, magnon modes are coupled oscillations of spin and orbital momenta with comparable amplitudes. We demonstrate excitations of magnon modes by directly coupling light with electronic orbital angular momentum, providing possibilities to develop magneto-optical devices operating at several terahertz with high output-to-input ratio.},
